## How To Use This Repository

There are several folders which contain the files necessary to reproduce the respective part of the work. The analyses are done in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and require several packages ([see Session Info](#session-info)) as well as [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). 

To reproduce part of the work simply open the respective .qmd file in RStudio and click the "Render" button. This generates an .html document containing the code as well as the output generated by it.
